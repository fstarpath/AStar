# FStar

FStar example

https://fstarpath.github.io/FStar-test-1/

This is a demonstration of a new pathfinding algorithm on a 2D grid. Comparing with AStar, we see an average of 50% decrease in the number of iterations that are taken for finding a path.

The video below shows the performance difference between AStar and FStar. FStar runs much faster in the video is due to the fact that it was hosted on a local machine. We expose the new algorithm via a web api. Here we are a doing a http call for each pathfinding step. So it is slower.
